### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on cool projects for my portfolio!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a little bit of everything I guess, but mainly Rust, Flutter, web2, web3 and AI. I probably should take some courses on Cybersecurity and DevOps as well...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on useful projects with experienced people that can help me to learn.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my next steps as a dev. I guess a mentor would be nice.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how could we work together on that cool idea that you have.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: pedrohbrasil7@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: amazing how devs can go from feeling like a god to feeling like trash (works both ways) in a matter of seconds lol
